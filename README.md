# Collections in Java : 
     
    - is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
    - Java collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation,           deletion.
    - A Collection represents a single unit of objects. i.e, a group
    
# What is a framework in Java ?
    
    - It provides ready made architecture.
    - It represents a set of classes and interfaces
    - it is optional.
  
# What is Collection Framework

    - The Colection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
                    1) Interfaces and its Implementations, i.e.. classes
                    2) Algorithm
    
    - The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for the Collection framework.
    - Iterable is an interface which extends Collection interface.
    - Collection interface extends List Interface, Queue Interface, Set Interface.
    - List Interface implements ArrayList class, implements LinkedList Class, Vector Class extends Stack class.
    - Queue Interface implements PriorityQueue class
    - Queue Interface extends Deque Interface implements ArrayDeque class, LinkedList class
    - Set Interface implements HashSet, LinkedJashSet classes
    - Set Interface extends SortedSet interface implements TreeSet class.
