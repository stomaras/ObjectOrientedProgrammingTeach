        // Abstraction is when you define the required functionality for something without actually
        // implementing the data house.
        // As i mention , interfaces are by definition, in Java, Abstract.
        // Abstract class vs Interface
        // 1. Type of methods : Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class can have abstarct and
              // non-abstract methods.
        // 2. Type of variables : Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.Interfaces
              // has only static and final variables.
        // 3. Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface
              // has only static and final variables.
        // 4. Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. Interface can not provide
             // the implementation of abstract class.
        // 5. Inheritance vs Abstraction : A Java interface can be implemented using keyword " implements " and
             // abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends"
        // 6. Multiple implementation: An interface can extend another java interface only, an abstract class can
            // extend another java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
        // 7. Accesibility of Data Members: Members of a java interface are public by default. A java abstract class can have
           // class members like private, protected, e.t.c, e.t.c.
